# Name:         Miro Simulint
# 
# Purpose:      Main script to run a launcher + lander simulation designed for
#               Physics students at Ume√• University
# 
# Usage:        Create a lander in the Landers.py file, or modify the DemoLander.
#               Likewise, create a launcher in Launchers.py. This Main file will
#               then insert your modules into the MIT environment where you test
#               them out. You can also compute and pass along input arguments to
#               use when creating your modules.
