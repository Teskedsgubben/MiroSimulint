# Name:         Miro Simulint
# 
# Purpose:      Main script to run a lander simulation designed to temporarilty 
#               replace the physically 3D-printed modules that are normally used
#               in the course. This is a virtual adaption due to COVID-19.
# 
# Usage:        Create a lander in the Landers.py file, or modify the DemoLander.
#               This Main file will then insert that lander into the MIT place at
#               the predetermined coordinates and throw it over the edge.
